## What I don't know

* What the heck is "Search for partial DisasterVictim?"
* What the heck is "Age or birthdate but not both can exist"
* What the heck is " Make sure you consider that UNIX- or Windows-style line endings might be used."

## What I Know:

* We do not need a concrete `Person` class because the only two possible people we care
  about are the Inquirer and the DisasterVictim.
* Could still have an abstract Person class
* In constructing tests: test valid, test invalid, test fringe/edge cases
* I'll have to implement a function in some `main()` that reads all the genders from the
file and prints it so the social worker can know what gender to input.
* I'll have to use recursion for familyrelation
*
