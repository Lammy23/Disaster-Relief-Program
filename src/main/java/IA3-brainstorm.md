## What I don't know

* What the heck is "Search for partial DisasterVictim?"
* What the heck is " Make sure you consider that UNIX- or Windows-style line endings might be used."

## What I Know:

* We do not need a concrete `Person` class because the only two possible people we care
  about are the Inquirer and the DisasterVictim.
* Could still have an abstract Person class
* In constructing tests: test valid, test invalid, test fringe/edge cases
* I'll have to implement a function in some `main()` that reads all the genders from the
file and prints it so the social worker can know what gender to input.
* I'll have to use recursion for familyRelation
* I only need the two tables in the sql file - Inquirer & InquirerLog. Don't overthink it, focus
on implementing the functions first.
* I am not my user. I am not my user. I am not my user. I am not my user. I am not my user.
I must explain everything in the README.
* You have the create your locations. The user cannot create locations.
* Name your submissions zip with your UCID
* No interfaces required
* Central workers don't work on disasterVictims, only local workers do.
* Maybe dont refresh the database every launch.
