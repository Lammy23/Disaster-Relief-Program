## What I don't know

* What the heck is "Search for partial DisasterVictim?"
* What the heck is "Age or birthdate but not both can exist"


## What I Know:
* We do not need a concrete `Person` class because the only two possible people we care
about are the Inquirer and the DisasterVictim.
* Could still have an abstract Person class
* In constructing tests: test valid, test invalid, test fringe/edge cases
