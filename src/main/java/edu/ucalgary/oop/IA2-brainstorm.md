# Brainstorm

## Individual Assignment 2

Before we begin, take a look at the rubric

> - [ ] Tests exist with valid data for all methods 
> (getters and setters may be combined), including all 
> versions of polymorphic methods. 
> All exceptions which can be thrown are tested. 
> Where values are checked, tests with invalid data exist. 
> Edge cases are considered.
> - [ ] All tests have clear names and useful messages.
> - [ ] Tests are established using Arrange, Act, Assert. 
> @Before and @After are used appropriately.
> - [ ] Tests appear to have correct syntax. Annotations are used. Includes are used. 
> Package name is correct. Test files are appropriately named.

In this assignment, we are required to make unit tests for
classes, methods and more.

We should use the `edu.ucalgary.oop` package.

Our main reference for the tests is the UML Diagram we
created.

It is helpful to watch the three videos on testing: 18A, 18B
and 18C.

- [ ] 18A
- [ ] 18B
- [ ] 18C

After watching the videos, refer to the tests you described
in an earlier assignment.
