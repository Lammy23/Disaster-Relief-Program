Problems Encountered and how I solved them
1. How to get data from the database: I was perplexed on how to do this properly. Do I write code that interfaces
directly with the database (and ignores the in-built OOP of Java) or do I write code that loads the database
info into Java objects. I'm more familiar with the former approach and the later approached seems like a lot
of work. However, since the main objective of the assignment is to learn OOP, encapsulation and data integrity
I decided to go with the latter approach (to give myself a challenge).
