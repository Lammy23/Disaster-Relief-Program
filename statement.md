Please indicate which requirements you attempted to implement. We will not test any
requirements which you indicate you did not attempt to implement, and you will not receive
marks for these requirements.

1. Appropriate data structures: Yes

I implemented various data structures in my program. 
I used a HashMap to store various key value pairs
I used a HashSet to enforce uniqueness in my program
I used a PriorityQueue to store the DisasterVictims in order of priority

2. Family relationship consistency: Yes

I implemented a recursive function to ensure that the family relationship is consistent.
This function ensures that duplicates are not possible and that the family relationship is consistent.

3. Supply consistency: Yes

I ensured that the supplies know the location they are stored in to ensure that the supply is consistent.

4. Use database: Yes

My program interfaces with the database to retrieve Inquirer queries and log new ones.

5. Multiple interactions with inquirer: Yes

I implemented an ArrayList of InquiryLog objects, a class I created, to store the Inquirer queries.
This was to account for one Inquirer making multiple queries.
As mentioned earlier, I also implemented a priority queue to store the DisasterVictims in order of priority.

6. Interface to enter DisasterVictims: yes

I implemented a command line interface to enter DisasterVictims.

7. Interface to log inquirer queries: Yes

I implemented a command line interface to log Inquirer queries.

8. Age or birthdate: Yes

I ensured that not both birthdate and Approximate age can be entered at the same time.

9. Gender options from file: Yes

I implemented various functions that interact with the
GenderOptions.txt file.
I also accounted for different line endings in the file by using
BufferedReader class.

10. Dietary restrictions: Yes

I implemented dietaryRestrictions as an Enum to ensure that only valid dietary restrictions are entered.
